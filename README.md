# ECommerce Website Testing "nopCommerce Demo Store"

This project involves testing the functionalities of the "nopCommerce demo store," an eCommerce website. A script is used to test various functions such as registration, login, searching for a specific product, adding it to the wishlist, and finally adding the product to the cart.

**Website URL**: [https://demo.nopcommerce.com/](https://demo.nopcommerce.com/)

## Testing Approach:

using the behavior-driven test development method. For this purpose, I utilized Selenium with Cucumber and Gherkin to write the scripts for the test cases. This approach enables checking the actual results and comparing them with the expected results in a structured manner.

## Implementation Details:

- **Selenium with Cucumber and Gherkin**: Used to write test scripts in a behavior-driven manner.
- **Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern**: Implemented for maintaining cleaner code and facilitating easy modifications in the future.
- **Test Runner**: Developed for regression testing to ensure the stability of the application over time.
